    <h1> COLD STORAGE </h1>
  
    <h4>Why cold storage ? </h4>
  
    <p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, not only individual homes but also 
      farmers,  pharmacies, hotels, restaurants, bars, (SMEs)etc. 
      lack access to affordable constant cold storage. This is due 
      to an unstable power supply that makes cold storage a
      pplications very difficult and expensive. On average Nigerians enjoy only 8 hours of electricity supply out of the 24 hours daily (BBC, 2020). This situation has led to a large amount of food and beverage waste and makes it difficult for pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics to maintain critical drugs and samples -resulting in loss of lives, 
      food insecurity, poverty, and extreme hunger.</p>
